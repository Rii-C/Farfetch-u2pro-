      How to shop & place an order?
    </div>
    <div class="answercont">
      <div class="answer">
       <h3>Do I need an account to place an order?</h3>
       <p>No, all you need is an email address. We recommend that you register for an account to start adding pieces to your Wishlist, but, you can also place and track orders as a guest and sign up at a time that suits you.</p>
       <h3>I have forgotten my password: what should I do?</h3>
       <p>Simply follow the 'Forgot your password?, link on our Sign In page and enter your email address. You'll then receive an email to reset your password.</p>
       <h3>How do I receive Farfetch email updates?</h3>
       <p>Stay informed of new arrivals, trends and exclusive promotions by entering your email address at the bottom of our homepage. You can then manage your email preferences under 'My Account'.</p>
       <h3>Where can I find size & fit advice?</h3>
       <p>Click on 'Size Guide' on the item's page to view our conversion chart. We also provide fit information and model measurements for each style under the 'Size & Fit' tab.</p>
       <h3>Can I cancel my Farfetch order or make changes to it?</h3>
       <p>Yes. Contact our Customer Service Advisors to do so. We're unable to add items to an existing order but we welcome you to place a new order for any additional pieces. Find out more in our Return & Refunds Policy.

        If you ordered a customised item, we can only accept cancellations up to 48 hours after you placed the order.</p>

      Farfetch pricing & Payment
    </div>
    <div class="answercont">
      <div class="answer">
      <h3>Why is Farfetch pricing special?</h3>
      <p>It's down to our unique business model. At Farfetch, you are shopping pieces from our luxury brands and partners worldwide, expertly curated for you by our team. Prices are determined by each Farfetch partner, so the price of the same item may vary depending on where it's coming from and your location. That's also why placing an item in your shopping bag or Wishlist won't reserve it at a particular price. </p>
      <h3>Which currencies can I shop in?</h3>
      <p>This is determined by your shipping destination and will be displayed at checkout before completing your purchase. If your local currency is unavailable, your order will be charged in USD for a competitive exchange rate.</p>
      <h3>When will my card be charged?</h3>
      <P>If you pay by debit card or PayPal, Farfetch will take payment at the point your order is placed on our site. If you pay by credit card, full payment is usually taken once your order is ready for shipping, but your bank or card issuer may reserve the order amount in your account immediately.</P>

      Afterpay
    </div>
    <div class="answercont">
      <div class="answer">
        <h3>How does Afterpay work?</h3>
        <p>With Installments by Afterpay, you can shop today and pay in four equal payments every 2 weeks, interest free. They accept both Mastercard and Visa credit and debit cards issued in your country of residence. You won't be able to pay with foreign issued cards with overseas banks, or pre-paid cards.</p>
        <h3>How do I use Installments by Afterpay?</h3>
        <p>Shop your favourite pieces and head to the checkout as normal, then choose 'Installments by Afterpay' as your payment method. First-time customers will need to register with Afterpay and provide payment details. If you're a returning customer, just log in and you're good to go. Your first payment will be around 2 weeks after the date you placed your order.</p>

    <div class="question">
      Product availability & authenticity
    </div>
    <div class="answercont">
      <div class="answer">
        <h3>Are you going to have my size again?</h3>
        <p>You can be the first to know! To be notified if a sold-out item becomes available again, click on 'Size Unavailable?' on the item's page, select the size you need, and then enter your email address.</p>
        <h3>Can I reserve an item to buy later?</h3>
        <p>We aim to provide a fair opportunity to shop our most in-demand styles and as items are often limited, we don't offer reservations.</p>
        <h3>Are Farfetch items authentic?</h3>
        <p>100%. Our offering is expertly curated from the best luxury fashion around the globe and we guarantee all items are authentic.</p>
        <h3>How will my order be packaged?</h3>
        <p>Your order will be carefully packaged in a protective Farfetch box — with branded dust bags if provided by the designer — to ensure it arrives to you in great condition.</p>

      Shiping, taxes & ducties
    </div>
    <div class="answercont">
      <div class="answer">
        <h3>What does Climate Conscious Delivery mean?</h3>
        <p>This varies depending on the size, weight and destination of your chosen items, and the cost will appear at the checkout. The good news is we offer One Shipping Fee for orders above a certain threshold - this means you can purchase multiple pieces from multiple locations for one fee.</p>
        <h3>How much will I be charged for shipping?</h3>
        <p>We offer a same day delivery service in some of the world's major cities - including Berlin, London, Manchester, Paris, Hong Kong SAR, Shanghai, Los Angeles, New York, Chicago, Dallas, Miami, Seattle, Milan, Rome, Barcelona and Madrid — when you shop from a Farfetch partner in that city. Simply order before 11am to receive delivery that same day, and after 11am for the next business day. Need more information?</p>
        <h3>Why can't I get my delivery?</h3>
        <p>We are able to deliver but current Indian government guidelines mean packages are not being allowed in or out of the country. As soon as restrictions are lifted, we will deliver safely to you.</p>

    <div class="answercont">
      <div class="answer">
       <h3>What is Farfetch's returns policy?</h3>

To create a return, go to ‘My Orders & Returns’ in your account, or head here if you checked out as a guest.</p>
       <h3>How do I book a free collection or return in store?</h3>
       <p>To request a return, go to 'My Orders & Returns' if you have an account, or click here if you placed an order as a guest. For our complimentary pick-up service, select 'By courier' and choose a collection date. We'll then send you a confirmation email with the next steps.</p>
       <h3>Can I return my customised item?</h3>
       <p>We are unable to accept returns as customised pieces are created to your specification and taste.</p>
